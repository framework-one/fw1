# FW/1 (Framework One) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/framework-one/fw1.png)](https://travis-ci.org/framework-one/fw1)

This FW/1 directory is a complete web application and expects to live in its own
webroot if you plan to run the applications within it. To use FW/1 in a separate
webroot you can either copy the `framework` directory to that webroot or add a mapping
for `/framework` to the `framework` folder inside this FW/1 directory. Note that since
your `Application.cfc` needs to extend `framework.one`, you have to add the mapping
in your admin - you can't just use a per-application mapping.

Please read the [Framework One Code of Conduct](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - we want FW/1 to be a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone to feel comfortable contributing!

# Running the Tests

FW/1 is setup to run tests on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/framework-one/fw1) using the `.travis.yml` file.

To run tests manually, you'll need [CommandBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox) installed.

Then run `box install` once to install the dependencies (TestBox is the only one currently).

Then start a server on port 8500 with your choice of CFML engine, e.g.,

    box server start cfengine=lucee@5 port=8500

This will open a browser, running the FW/1 "Introduction" app.

You can then run the tests:

    box testbox run verbose=false

If you get any failures, you can run this with more verbose, but still compact output:

    box testbox run reporter=mintext
