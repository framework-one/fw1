This FW/1 directory is a complete web application and expects to live in its own
webroot if you plan to run the applications within it. To use FW/1 in a separate
webroot you can either copy the org directory to that webroot or add a mapping
for /org/corfield to the corfield folder inside the org directory (or a /org
mapping to the org directory directly).
